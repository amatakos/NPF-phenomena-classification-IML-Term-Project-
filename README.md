# NPF-phenomena-classification-IML-Term-Project-
Repository for the 2021 IML term project (Group 69)

## Problem Statement
The term project involved building a machine learning model for classification of [NPF phenomena](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aadf3c). These occur on days when small particles begin to form larger new particles and by spreading out affect weather and air pollution, among other things. The primary task was to predict if an event were to occur on a certain day, and the exact type of event could be found as a secondary task. Data from measurements at the Hyytiälä forestry field station (seen above) were made \hrefavailable for the purposes of the project.


## Motivation
Besides the apparent motivation for completing the course, our team intended to try its best to win the unofficial challenge in binary and multi-class classification accuracy. Apart from that, it was intriguing to tackle a real problem with real data, and see how we could apply our knowledge for solving a practical task. 

## Goals 
Our goal was to complete all of the project's tasks to the best of our capabilities, namely the challenge submission, the presentation and the report. At the same time, our goals for the project were inherently tied to our goals for the course, which were in-depth understanding of the various techniques and methods spanning all of the typical machine learning pipeline, such as feature selection, model selection and cross-validation.  Finally, a common goal we all set from the beginning, was to do our best through teamwork, respecting and enabling all members to contribute freely.
